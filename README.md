# bookmarks-chrome-extension
Chrome extension to save bookmarks without having to go to your folder in https://vayo.cc

## TODO:
- save current folders in variable to no repeat request (probably not a good idea, because it's impossible to know if a user deleted/created a new folder in the webapp)
- improve design
[x] let user switch folders
[x] pay https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/register
